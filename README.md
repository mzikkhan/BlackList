# BlackList

We have developed a platform where students of an institution can report incidents of cyber-bullying. They can choose to provide evidence in terms of screenshots or screen
recordings. They can also choose to report it anonymously. This will then be handled by the institution who can choose to store the complaint
on the bully's public student profile in order to deter future such incidents from happening.

I have developed this project with my teammates Absara Chowdhury and Farhan Ishrak Tahmid. We have used simple HTML,CSS,JavaScript for the frontend and Django for 
the backend. We utilised SQLite3 database for our data manipulation. 

The site can be accessed here: http://blacklistapphacknsu.pythonanywhere.com/
